"""
One-time script — generates frontend/public/courses.json
Fetches all courses across all USC departments using the existing scraper infrastructure.
Run from the backend directory with the venv active:
    python generate_course_list.py            # refuses to overwrite if total shrinks
    python generate_course_list.py --force     # overwrite anyway

Why sequential + long timeout:
  The USC API is very slow for some departments (e.g. DSO ~110s) and returns
  TRUNCATED course lists under concurrent load with no error. A concurrent run
  therefore silently undercounts (DSO dropped to 1, CSCI 80→54, etc.). Fetching
  one department at a time with a generous timeout returns the true counts.
